		<h3><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
		<p>An Unhosted WebDAV service acts as an always-on data storage
		for its users. It does not host any application source code, nor does it execute
		any processing.
		 To make use of an Unhosted WebDAV account, the user visits unhosted web apps 
		that run in a browser, or user-agent. This user-agent discovers the user's
		Unhosted WebDAV service through WebFinger. It then redirects the user to an OAuth
		dialogue, to establish authentication. Finally, it uses WebDAV to read and write the
		data on the Unhosted WebDAV account.
		</p>
		<p>This document is meant for implementers of an
		<strong>Unhosted WebDAV service</strong>. It descibes how an Unhosted WebDAV
		service should behave. <strong>Developers</strong> of unhosted web apps should
		download the <a href="https://github.com/unhosted/remoteStorage.js/">SDK</a> instead.
		<strong>End-users</strong> who are interested in understanding the concepts
		behind the unhosted web, are better off reading this <a 
		href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/fellowship-interviews/?p=299">interview</a>. In any case, follow our <a
		href="https://groups.google.com/group/unhosted">mailing list</a> for all the latest updates.  </p> <p> In order
		for your service to comply with the Unhosted WebDAV standard, it needs to
		implement <strong>WebFinger, OAuth2-cs, WebDAV, Http Basic auth, and
		CORS</strong>. All of these technologies should be configured to work together
		in the way that this specification describes using the keywords "MUST", "SHOULD"
		and "SHOULD EITHER .. OR", in the meaning specified by <a
		href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">rcf2119</a>.  </p> <p>Throughout this
		text, we use several variables, which are written in capitals, and with a $-sign
		in front of them. They describe the interaction between a user, this user's
		Unhosted WebDAV service (aka her unhosted account), and an application. The
		variables are: </p> <ul> <li><strong>$USERNAME</strong> - the local part of the
		user's global user identifier, that's to say, the part before the '@' sign.</li>
		<li><strong>$USERDOMAIN</strong> - the server part of the user's global user
		identifier, that's to say, the part after the '@' sign.</li>
		<li><strong>$DAVURL</strong> - the base URL of the Unhosted WebDAV service.</li>
		<li><strong>$APP</strong> - the URL of the application</li>
		<li><strong>$RESOURCE</strong> - the string identifying the resource to which
		the user is granting the application access. By default, $RESOURCE = $APP.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3><a id="finger">WebFinger</a></h3>

		<p>The Unhosted WebDAV service MUST
		implement <a
		href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/wiki/WebFingerProtocol">WebFinger</a>
		 and with <a
		href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/32686/xrd-1.0-wd01.html">XRD</a>
		formatting. In the WebFinger data for <strong>$USERNAME @ $USERDOMAIN</strong>,
		it should announce an https-based <strong>$DAVURL</strong> with
		<strong>rel</strong>-attribute
		'<strong>http://unhosted.org/spec/dav/0.1</strong>' . All WebFinger-related
		resources SHOULD be served over 
		<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818">https</a> and MUST be served with <a
		href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a> headers that allow their retrieval
		from any origin.  </p>
		<h3><a id="oauth">OAuth2-cs</a></h3>
		<p>Given the <strong>$DAVURL</strong>
		announced via WebFinger, the Unhosted WebDAV implementer MUST make <a
		href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-13#section-4.2">OAuth2-cs</a>
		available on <strong>$DAVURL/oauth2/auth</strong> (no need for CORS headers
		here, because OAuth does redirection and not AJAX).  </p>
		<h3><a id="DAV">WebDAV</a></h3>
		<p>Whenever a user <strong>$USERNAME @ $USERDOMAIN</strong> grants an
		<strong>$APP</strong> access to a <strong>$RESOURCE</strong>, the Unhosted
		WebDAV implementer MUST make a WebDAV server available on
		<strong>$DAVURL/webdav/$USERDOMAIN/$USERNAME/$RESOURCE/</strong>, with CORS
		headers that allow access from whichever <strong>$APP</strong> sends it valid
		credentials.  </p>
			
			<p>Non-normative hint: For this, it is necessary to 
		exclude (apart from the HEAD and GET verbs) the OPTIONS verb 
		from the http basic auth restrictions. It is also necessary to set the
		-Allow-Credentials header to true, and to echo the Origin specified in the
		request headers back in the -Allow-Origin header (setting it to '*' works for
		the Webfinger URL, but not here, because of an extra restriction on CORS that
		applies when there are credentials involved). An example of how to configure
		this in apache's mod_dav can be found <a
		href="https://github.com/unhosted/remoteStorage.js">here</a>.  </p>
		<h3><a id="basicauth">Http basic auth</a></h3>
		<p>Whenever a user, who is successfully identified as <strong>$USERNAME
		@ $USERDOMAIN</strong> by the OAuth2-cs authentication server, and has
		successfully granted application <strong>$APP</strong> access to resource
		<strong>$RESOURCE</strong>, the OAuth access token given out to the
		<strong>$APP</strong> MUST be a valid <a
		href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt">http basic auth</a> password for
		<strong>$DAVURL/webdav/$USERDOMAIN/$USERNAME/$RESOURCE/</strong>, when combined
		with the concatenation of <strong>$USERNAME</strong>, '<strong>@</strong>', and
		<strong>$USERDOMAIN</strong> as the http basic auth username.  
		Http basic auth MUST be required for all verbs except OPTIONS, HEAD and GET.
		This means all content on the DAV server will be read/write-able for <strong>$USERNAME
		@ $USERDOMAIN</strong>, and world-readable. It is the responsibility of the application to add
		a payload encryption layer on top of this (end-to-end encryption).
		</p>
		
		<h3><a id="registration">Registration</a></h3>
		<p>In addition to the '<a
		href="http://hueniverse.com/2009/03/the-discovery-protocol-stack/">lrdd</a>'
		entry that is needed in
		<strong>https://$USERDOMAIN/.well-known/host-meta</strong> as part of WebFinger,
		the implementer of Unhosted WebDAV SHOULD also add a '<strong>register</strong>'
		entry. It should contain a template with two variables: <strong>{uri}</strong>
		and <strong>{redirect_url}</strong>. It SHOULD then also offer a human-readable
		web page with registration information on the URL that is constructed by filling
		in the concatenation of '<strong>acct:</strong>', <strong>$USERNAME</strong>,
		'<strong>@</strong>', and <strong>$USERDOMAIN</strong> for the
		<strong>{uri}</strong> variable, and a redirect URL for the
		<strong>{redirect_url}</strong> variable. This registration page SHOULD EITHER
		allow the user to register a new unhosted account identified by
		<strong>$USERNAME @ $USERDOMAIN</strong>, OR provide human-readable information
		about why this is not being offered (for instance, if the username is taken, or
		if the server is not currently accepting registrations, or if some out-of-band
		actions are needed, like "if you are an ACME employee, but haven't received the
		credentials for your unhosted account yet, then please contact the helpdesk on
		it@acme.com"). Whether registration as a new user is successful or not, upon
		completion the user-agent SHOULD be redirected back to the url that was filled
		in as the <strong>{redirect-url}</strong> in the template.  </p>
		
		<h3><a id="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
		<p> A non-normative example
		implementation of this specification is currently visible by visiting the
		world's first unhosted web app, on <a
		href="https://myfavouritesandwich.org/" target="_blank">myfavouritesandwich.org</a>, or
		viewing its <a href="http://www.myfavouritesandwich.org/unhosted.js" target="_blank">javascript</a>,
		and <a href="httpTrace.txt" target="_blank">here</a> is a stripped down
		representation of the http trace it produces. It is up to the application, and
		beyond the scope of this spec, to implement end-to-end encryption on top of
		this, possibly using the Stanford Javascript Crypto Library, possibly in a
		WebWorker process. This text may be changed for clarity - its history is tracked
		<a
		href="https://github.com/unhosted/unhosted.github.com/commits/master/spec/dav/0.1/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
		However, the standard it describes was frozen on <strong>5 April 2011</strong>.
		The standard will not change for at least 6 months (until at least <strong>5
		October 2011</strong>). Even then, if at any point after that improvements to
		this standard are deemed desirable, every attempt will be made to make those
		changes non-breaking. We will follow <a href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank">semantic versioning</a>.
