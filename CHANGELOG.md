  name

# draft-dejong-remotestorage-11.txt

No changes, just extended the expiry date by 6 months.

# draft-dejong-remotestorage-09.txt

## Breaking for clients:
* The content-type header value on a PUT request is now explicitly required
  to be a valid Content-Type. This is only to align with the HTTP spec, and
  server implementations are encouraged to still just treat it as an opaque
  ASCII string, rather than comparing it to some whitelist of valid values.

# draft-dejong-remotestorage-08.txt

No changes, just extended the expiry date by 6 months.

# draft-dejong-remotestorage-07.txt

## Breaking for servers:
* The app manifest is no longer guaranteed to contain a 'datastores-access'
  field.

## Breaking for clients:
* Zero-click login when the app is opened through the `remotestorage=` URL
  fragment parameter (the storage-first flow) is no longer allowed, the app
  should now ask for user confirmation before proceeding to connect. Also, if a
  `remotestorage=` parameter is present, the `access_token=` and `scope=`
  parameters should be ignored.

# draft-dejong-remotestorage-06.txt

## Breaking for servers as well as clients:
* The difference between 401 and 403 http response status was clarified to match
  the way they are defined by the Bearer token spec.
* Content-Range headers are no longer allowed on PUT requests.
* The Expires: 0 header was replaced by Cache-Control: no-cache.
* The WebFinger examples were updated to conform to the WebFinger spec. This
  includes changing `false` values to `null`, for example.

## Breaking for servers:
* Apart from GET requests, HEAD requests are also allowed without Authorization
  request header on public documents.
* Servers that support range requests should now announce this not only through
  WebFinger, but also through the HTTP 'Accept-Ranges' header.

## Breaking for clients:
* Apart from acct:me@mydomain.com ('me@mydomain.com' in UI), http://mydomain.com/
  ('mydomain.com' in UI) is now allowed as a user address for WebFinger discovery.
* Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * is now also allowed on requests with preflight.
  This was changed in the CORS spec, and has already been implemented by all major
  browsers.
* Item names '.' and '..' are no longer allowed.

# draft-dejong-remotestorage-05.txt

## Breaking for servers as well as clients:
* The link relation in the WebFinger announcement was updated from 'remotestorage'
  to 'http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-dejong-remotestorage' (issue #78).
* The version string in the WebFinger announcement was updated from -04 to -05.

## Breaking for clients:
* Servers MAY respond with a 4xx response code if the Content-Type is not an
  ASCII string, is too long, is missing altogether, etc. (issues #84
  and #86).

## Breaking for servers as well as clients:
* The version string in the WebFinger announcement was updated from -03 to -04

* Servers may now offer any extension features they want.
* Several mistakes in the text and wire examples were fixed.
* Several confusing formulations in the text were improved.
* Mention "group accounts", to which multiple human users have access.

* The version string in the WebFinger announcement was updated from -02 to -03
* Switch to the datastores-access syntax in open web app manifest format

* Servers MUST now comply with all of HTTP/1.1, including chunked uploads
